                  <h6>•	Narrow AI is a type of AI that can perform a dedicated task with intelligence.<br> The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.</h6>
                  <h6>•	Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task.<br> Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.</h6>
                  <h6>•	Apple Siri is a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions.</h6>
                  <h6>•	IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI,<br> as it uses an Expert system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.</h6>
                  <h6>•	Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce sites,<br> self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.</h6>
